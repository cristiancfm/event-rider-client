# Event Rider (Web Client)

## Introduction
**Event Rider** is a web application to manage and visualize events, which allows
users to create and find events happening at a specific place in a simple way.

Users may filter events or view them using an interactive map, and also save events 
into their profiles or get email notifications by subscribing to events and categories or 
following other users.

Administrators can manage users, events and categories using a separate section of the 
application. They can approve or reject events created by users, create or remove
categories, suspend or mark users as verified, designate new administrators, etc.
